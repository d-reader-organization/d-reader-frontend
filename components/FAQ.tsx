				<Expandable title={`‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR: "wallet aaa..aaa is not eligible for mint"`} id='wallet-not-eligible-for-mint'>
					<p>
						When wallet is not eligible for minting it could mean that you haven&apos;t completed all of the
						prerequisites.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some of our mints require users to have verified email addresses. If you&apos;re trying to collect a mint
						from a referral bonus, you&apos;ll need to onboard at least 2 users to dReader AND they&apos;ll need to
						verify their email and connect their wallet (fully onboarded)
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly, there is an <Important>important note</Important> to make regarding how wallets are allowlisted for
						mints on dReader. We only allowlist the wallet you have first connected to your user.
						<br />
						For example: you might have 3 wallets connected and have just onboarded 2 friends to dReader. In this case,
						we&apos;ll allowlist the wallet which you&apos;ve first connected to the app. Your other 2 wallets
						won&apos;t have the rights to mint the referral bonus.
					</p>
					<p>This is in order to prevent abuse. We will work on improving this user experience in 2024.</p>

				<Expandable title={`‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR: "wallet aaa..aaa has reached the mint limit"`} id='wallet-reached-mint-limit'>
					Some of our mints have limitations of NFTs per wallet basis. For example, your wallet might only be eligible
					for 1 free mint, 2 public (paid) discounted mints, and unlimited public (full price) mints.

					Phantom has an issue with their Seed Vault implementation on Saga. If you see this errror, you&apos;re most
					likely using Saga and Phantom.
					<br />
					We have worked with Phantom to resolve the issue which should be live by now. Update Phantom to the latest
					version from the dApp store and retry.
					<br />
					If the issue persists, connect your seed phrase to the Solflare wallet. Works like a charm. ü§å

				<Expandable title={`‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR: "not enough SOL in your wallet"`} id='not-enough-sol'>
					It&apos;s in my personal interest to have as many comic enthusiasts on the platform. If the money is

					Especially if you&apos;re trying to mint the free comic but don&apos;t have 0.029 SOL to pay for on-chain &
